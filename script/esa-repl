=head1 NAME

esa-repl - A quick example client for talking asynchronously to App::EvalServerAdvanced

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Just a quick demo and example of how to talk to App::EvalServerAdvanced.  
Right now it only connects to localhost:14401, and this isn't configurable.  
The language can be set via the first argument to the script.
